# ZCPP
The official ZCPP (Zyphery C Plus Plus) Repo containing all ZCPP files

Most of the ZCPP files are single files, meaning, to use them just import the single file and you're ready to go
The code is unoptimized and just for educational purposes (my education). You are free to modify and use my code.

There are many libraries that I am working on but I will not publish them all (only the ones that are single file). Plus some of them are for unique purposes that can't be used on their own.
